While some people have kept it on despite the peeling, some have ended up scratching their pinky fairly significantly on it, so it's worth considering its removal or finding a better adhesive.</p> <p>The rubberized turntable grip itself is also susceptible to peeling, but it's far more reliable, perhaps miscare or improper installations from Dao lead to problems sooner, but for many it will last several years without a problem.</p> <p>Another concern is in only in having a <code>START</code> and <code>EFFECT</code> at the top of the controller. IIDX utilizes 3 buttons in menu navigation, namely <code>START</code>, <code>EFFECT</code>, and <code>VEFX</code> so the limited option is a bit troublesome. However, the solution to this problem DJ DAO utilizes is the ability for the <code>EFFECT</code> button to take multiple inputs as separate bindings. To simplify this further, enabling this option allows single, double, and triple taps of the <code>EFFECT</code> button in rapid succession to be 3 different bindings, alleviating the need for another button.</p> <p>Unfortunately though, this does add latency to the button, it also doesn't feel too natural, and many owners use more responsive custom firmware over DJ DAO's firmware that, at the time of writing, doesn't support this multiselect feature anyways, meaning the problem is still present. Many users choose to upgrade from the default USB board to a custom one (Arduino, Arcin) since the button lights can't be controlled via software and it's only polling at the default 250hz. Of course that also means you can't use the original board's PS2 connector anymore.</p> <p>One thing to note with the rubberized turntable grip, this controller gets gross. Dead skin will build up around the edges of the turntable itself on the metal and along the edges of the rubber grip. Regular cleaning is required.</p> <p>All in all, this controller has a few minor problems but is often regarded as the best balance between price and performance, as it matches arcade play at a great price.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#phoenixwan","title":"PHOENIXWAN","text":"<p>The Phoenixwan, sometimes jokingly referred to as the wang, or phoenixwang, is a rather odd controller. It fills a niche that wasn't needed (Gamo2's site was already selling 6 different IIDX controllers) but still manages to be the smallest full-sized beatmania controller offered on the site.</p> <p>As expected, the spacing between the buttons and turntable is arcade accurate, and the turntable is full sized unlike the FP7. Moreover, 4 buttons are present for menu navigation this time around. </p> <p>The controller is also very flashy, with a customizable turntable LED that emits 16 million different colors, turntable sensitivity adjustment, and an audio light mode that tries its best to \"dance with the music\" in fanciful fashion, it's a neat gimmick. Lastly for maximum portability, this controller is very light and even features wire storage at the bottom.</p> <p>However, with the flashy style this controller brings it unfortunately takes a few steps backwards in other areas. One of the most perplexing areas are the feet, there's no other way to put it, some surfaces it's great and some it sucks. With the reduced weight, this controller will slide across some surfaces with ease leading to a really unpleasant experience. It would not be surprising if with improper play that the controller could be moved very easily by accident.</p> <p>Onto one of the more defining features though, the turntable grip. Gamo2's site says it's made of liquid silicone and space aluminum. The grip is fantastic, it's incredibly grippy and a lot of fun to stop on a dime back and forth on your hand. But this material doesn't come without some faults unfortunately, it gets turned into a fingerprint magnet right out of the box, and some users have reported the grip wears off and becomes flat after heavy usage. One could also argue that making a controller trying to replicate an arcade experience (hence arcade-style) that it's a bit backwards to deviate away from the arcade experience as well, but that's more semantics than anything.</p> <p>Lastly and most critically, a fair batch of buyers reported PCB problems where the board seemed to flat out die after just a few months. Apparently a firmware update can be pushed to work around some issues, but there's not much that's definitive as a solution in regards to this issue at the time of writing. </p> <p>Overall, the Phoenixwan is probably the best option in terms of portability and style, it's a very flashy device and great to take over to a friend's for some fun. But, with it comes a heftier price tag that might not be worth it for people looking to simply enjoy the game. With some critical issues, this controller might just be style over substance.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#yuancon-iidx","title":"YuanCon IIDX","text":"<p>YuanCon's IIDX controller looks rather plain, doesn't it?

The \"Chinese\" switches are definitely not recommended and feel bad.</p> <p>This controller oddly uses an acrylic turntable as well, while it's a nice attempt it's somewhat disappointing overall. At the very least, it's fairly easy to modify the turntable and place something more proper such as an EMP mat on it for a better experience. Just note that the screws are not countersunk around the center of the turntable.</p> <p>Some people may be dissatisfied that the turntable has no lights too, an obvious cost cutting decision.</p> <p>The default buttons are typical cheap Chinese ones, these risk occasionally getting stuck around the enclosure's corners but it's less common than Chinese buttons for use on other games such as Pop'n and some users don't end up with any problems at all. Depending on a buyer's level of tolerance they may find these buttons fine or desperately yearn for an upgrade.</p> <p>One big positive for many is the detachable USB cable, it uses just one USB port which is quite handy. This comes at some costs though. The biggest issue is the lack of PS2 support, the lights are also dimmer than Dao's offerings which utilize 2 USB ports.</p> <p>Yuan's IIDX attempt is solid, but it's not without fault.

I'll try to cover springs, microswitches, and buttons to the best of my ability. </p> <p>I've also documented many of the parts that I talk about and where to buy them here</p> <ul> <li> <p>Buttons/Keys</p> <p>The most commonly used buttons are Sanwa, Gersung, and DJ DAO/Yuan Chinese buttons. </p> <p>I can't really speak for every arcade in Japan, but both in Japan and US almost all arcades use Sanwa buttons. The Samduck buttons are a Korean variant that can be found in Korean arcades, but are still superceded by Sanwa buttons. The DJ Dao/Yuancon buttons are cheap Chinese clones that feel less satisfying both in physical feedback and audio feedback. Some players find them servicable, but I ultimately recommend upgrading when possible. The travel distance is different on Dao buttons for example due to the inaccurate construction having a different height than official parts like Sanwa, so the feeling will be significantly different in using them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Microswitches and Springs</p> <p>If you buy the keys sepearately it's worth noting what spring and microswitch setups they come with:</p> <ul> <li>Sanwa keys come with 100g springs and 100g Omron switches.</li> <li>Samduck keys come with 20g springs and 65g Gersung switches.</li> <li>DJ DAO keys come with 40g springs and 20g Honeywell switches.</li> </ul> <p>There are also many other cheap Chinese variants that I won't bother listing because I insist you do not play on them. Please stick to Omron or Gersung microswitches for an enjoyable play experience! The Honeywell microswitches for example are an incredibly cheap feeling switch that often breaks easily.</p> <p>With this in mind, the most common switch and spring setups are 50g/20g, 50g/60g, and 50g/100g setups  (microswitch listed first, then springs in this case). However, you will find arcades around the world using a myriad of setups.</p> <p>By default for a new or inexperienced player, I would recommend a 50g/60g setup as it's a safe setup that won't require frequent maintenance, has a nice weighted feeling that will help build stamina, and isn't too light for charts with heavy amounts of jacks. That said, it ultimately comes down to user preference, with lighter setups running the risk of more maintenance, but being easier on one's hands especially for dense charts, and heavier setups being more sturdy, but easily tiring out one's hands, 100g/100g for example however, is too extreme for the grand majority of players and simply exhausting and painful to play on.</p> <p>One thing worth noting is many tournaments in Japan have utilized a 25g/60g setup as well, with the heavy springs being beneficial for jacks, just as one example.</p> <p>Your springs will also naturally lose resistance over time, so if you played at an arcade with a heavily worn setup I'm sure you'll find it feels very different to your brand new home setup even if you have the same weight ratings.</p> <p>Experimentation is strongly recommended regardless as you become a more developed and experienced player. If you love the game, don't be afraid of traveling to try out different setups or dropping some more cash on parts to experiment.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#sound-voltex","title":"Sound Voltex","text":""},{"location":"extras/ascs/#dj-dao-svse5","title":"DJ DAO SVSE5","text":"<p>The SVSE5 is a pretty straightforward controller without much to worry about, the sizing is very compact while retaining proper arcade spacing between the knobs and buttons at a very reasonable price, most of the gripes with this controller will come based on what parts are used.

Some Korean arcades use Gersung Samduck parts however, a good Korean-made alternative. There are also various Chinese parts of equally garbage quality. If you order a controller with the stock Chinese buttons, they are including the cheap Chinese springs. These are fine, it's only a spring after all!

On top of this, the pricing is extremely competitive and shipping prices are more fair than Gamo2. With this however, comes a lack of availability. Controllers often go out of stock so it's important to keep up with when pre-orders and restocks are going up.</p> <p>Default Yuan buttons are the typical cheap Chinese buttons that are not ideal for play, some users report less trouble with the buttons than Dao's default buttons, but Sanwas are always preferable. Yuan thankfully doesn't even bother with Honeywell switches, only offering Omron microswitches instead, a welcomed decision.</p> <p>Perhaps due to inexperience or quality control issues, there has been a notable minority of people with issues that have to be acknowledged below.</p> <p>Shipping times have varied widely, the grand majority of buyers get their packages promptly within 1-2 weeks, but there have been reports of some extreme cases well over 4+ weeks. This situation however was met promptly with an official statement from Yuan and his team. However, at the time of writing, I am aware of someone that has been waiting for their controller to ship for over 3 months.</p> <p>Some controllers have also arrived damaged or with missing elements. One prominent example was a large number of broken panels prompting refunds and a manufacturing change.</p> <p>Also worth noting that again at the time of writing, YuanCon's RGB offerings literally have LEDs that brown out and their engineer \"does not want to add HID lighting.\" Both a comical and egregious negative.</p> <p>It's worth noting that despite these negatives, Yuan and his team have made great efforts to stay very communicative and ensure that nobody ends up with a faulty product they're dissatisfied with, as shown in the above links. YuanCon's support and communication is top notch, and the future remains promising. Even if there's a small risk of initial hassle through slow shipping or quality control, buyers will ultimately end up with a fully functioning product that they can be satisfied with one way or another.</p>"},{"location":"extras/ascs/#steprevolution-stepmaniax","title":"StepRevolution (StepManiaX)","text":"<ul> <li>Website: https://shop.steprevolution.com/</li> </ul> <p>Premium pads, spare parts and full cabinets that are designed to either play StepmaniaX or have other games run on them are for sale, there is official support for setting up a normal computer for use with stepmania or if you have the right configuration you can use Pump it up simulators with the cabinet aswell, and Kyle Ward is always very helpful for anyone who has questions!</p> <p>Only downside is the pads/cabs sell out usually within minutes of them going on sale and the shipping time can be multiple months some times as they are done made to order.

Please note that a polling rate is NOT THE REFRESH RATE of a monitor, but is the critical factor in determining how responsive a touchscreen is and is unfortunately something every major retailer omits from their product listings due to lack of consumer awareness.</p> <p>At higher levels of gameplay, rapid button presses may fail to be acknowledged by touchscreen monitors with a low polling rate, making good scores impossible and creating a frustrating experience.</p> <p>Every BEMANI game with a touchscreen polls at 250hz, and some use an IR grid to achieve this. Thus, I am defining viable as 180hz or more, but I will include some monitors and manufacturer dates under this to help curious buyers be aware, as sometimes different manufacturer dates result in different polling rates and it's always good to document cruddy monitors to save people money.</p> <p>One thing to note is, this is not to say that monitors with low polling rates are unusable, they can still provide enjoyment and are often cheap enough to be a great option to see how far one may want to get into a certain touchscreen based game. But, the goal is to provide a potential buyer information to make an educated choice, and monitors with low polling rates will run the risk of needing to be replaced as higher levels of play, potentially causing frustration and wasted money.</p> <p>If you want to check your touch screen monitor's polling rate simply download Mouse Rate Checker and move your finger across the window at a reasonable pace, but not too fast!</p>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#dell-s2240t","title":"Dell S2240T","text":"<ul> <li>2013 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>200hz GREAT!</li> </ul> </li> <li>2014 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>May: 200hz GREAT!</li> <li>September: 180hz</li> </ul> </li> <li>2015 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>March: 200hz GREAT!</li> <li>September: 200hz GREAT!</li> </ul> </li> <li>Late 2016 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>140hz AVOID</li> </ul> </li> <li>Early 2017 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>180hz</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mid 2017 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>140hz AVOID</li> </ul> </li> <li>February 2018 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>180hz</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#dell-p2314t","title":"Dell P2314T","text":"<ul> <li>November 2015 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>60hz DO NOT BUY!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#dell-p2418ht","title":"Dell P2418HT","text":"<ul> <li>May 2018 Manufacturing Date:<ul> <li>60hz DO NOT BUY!</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/pollingrates/#iiyama-t2336msc","title":"Iiyama T2336MSC","text":"<ul> <li>Revision B1:<ul> <li>180hz</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"extras/softether/","title":"Setting Up SoftEther VPN for Cabinet-to-Cabinet Play","text":""},{"location":"extras/softether/#what-is-softether-vpn","title":"What is SoftEther VPN?","text":"<p>SoftEther VPN is a free tool we use to create Virtual Hubs and connect multiple machines to the same virtual network, allowing the ability to perform Cabinet-to-Cabinet link even when the machines are on physically different networks.</p>"},{"location":"extras/softether/#configuring-softether-server","title":"Configuring SoftEther Server","text":"<p>This part of the guide is for hosting a hub!

In SpiceTools, simply add the windowed mode parameter, this parameter is <code>-w</code> and can be placed right after any other desired parameters chosen in our <code>gamestart.bat</code></p> <p>As for the touch stuff, by default SpiceTools should detect your mouse just fine, you can use the <code>-s</code> parameter to have your cursor show at all times above the game window. For touchscreen monitors, it's a bit tricky to write something encompassing them all. Many should be detected automatically, however some may require adding the <code>-wintouch</code> parameter for support.</p> <p>You can check out some documented touchscreen monitors here.</p> <p>With that, you're all done! The final step you'll have to do with your chosen tools is simply setting up your desired keybinds!
