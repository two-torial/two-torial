Then, exit out of that menu and head to <code>NETWORK OPTIONS</code> from back inside the service menu.</p> <p>If it doesn't transition to HD, after you've saved, you can simply reboot the game and all should be well.</p> <p></p> <p>The final thing we need to set is here inside <code>NETWORK OPTIONS</code>, we will need to set a shop name to play, so select the <code>SHOP NAME SETTING</code> option.

In SpiceTools, simply add the windowed mode parameter, this parameter is <code>-w</code> and can be placed right after any other desired parameters chosen in our <code>gamestart.bat</code></p> <p>As for the touch stuff, by default SpiceTools should detect your mouse just fine, you can use the <code>-s</code> parameter to have your cursor show at all times above the game window. For touchscreen monitors, it's a bit tricky to write something encompassing them all. Many should be detected automatically, however some may require adding the <code>-wintouch</code> parameter for support.</p> <p>With that, you're all done! The final step you'll have to do with your chosen tools is simply setting up your desired keybinds!
