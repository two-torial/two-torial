### DirectSound

!!! tip ""

    The legacy Windows audio system, still used by older games.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Extremely high compatibility, especially with older games
      - Multiple audio sources can play simultaneously
      - Easy audio capture with OBS, Discord etc.
      - Simple to set up and use

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Highest latency of all modes
      - Being phased out in favor of WASAPI
      - Limited audio quality compared to modern modes

### WASAPI Shared

!!! tip ""

    The modern Windows standard audio mode. Recommended for most users.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Works with most modern games and applications
      - Multiple audio sources can play simultaneously
      - Easy audio capture with OBS, Discord etc.
      - Good balance of latency and compatibility

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Higher latency than Exclusive mode
      - Some games may require patches/configuration for Shared mode

    üí° **Pro tip**: Use spice2x's `-lowlatencysharedaudio` setting to reduce latency.

### WASAPI Exclusive

??? warning "Hardware compatibility notice"

    Your audio device must explicitly support exclusive mode. Check your audio settings:

    <img src="/img/common/audio_exclusive.png">

!!! tip ""

    Gives one application complete control over the audio device.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Significantly lower latency than Shared mode
      - More consistent audio processing than Shared mode
      - Better for rhythm games if you don't mind the cons

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Only one application can output audio at a time
      - No audio capture without special hardware/software
      - Can cause system-wide audio interruptions

### ASIO

!!! warning "Hardware requirements"

    For optimal results, use a dedicated ASIO-compatible audio interface. Software solutions like [ASIO4ALL](https://asio4all.org/) or [FlexASIO](https://github.com/dechamps/FlexASIO) exist but have limitations:

    - Added processing overhead
    - May not improve latency over WASAPI Exclusive
    - Mostly useful when:
        - Games are incompatible with your audio device
        - ASIO is the only supported mode
        - You need specific ASIO features

!!! tip ""

    Professional audio standard designed for audio interfaces and music production.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Lowest possible latency when properly configured
      - Direct hardware control
      - Precise buffer size adjustment
      - Professional-grade audio quality
      - Bypass Windows audio stack
	  - Capture is possible when routed through Voicemeeter at the cost of very little added latency

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Requires specialized hardware for best results
      - Complex setup process
      - Usually limited to one application at a time
      - No direct audio capture support
      - System performance heavily impacts stability
      - May require significant tweaking

## ASIO Recording/Streaming

!!! info "This guide assumes your game already uses ASIO and you want to record/stream with audio."

### Required software

!!! tip ""

    ASIO bypasses the Windows audio system that recording/streaming applications use, so you'll need additional software to route the audio:

    - [Voicemeeter Banana](https://vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) - For audio routing
    - [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) - For recording and streaming

    Install both applications before continuing.

### Game configuration

!!! tip ""

    Set your game's ASIO output device to `Voicemeeter Virtual ASIO`:

    - For spice2x games: Look for settings like `-iidxasio` or `-sdvxasio` at the top of spicecfg's `Options` tab
    - For other games: The location depends on your setup, but look for ASIO device selection

### Voicemeeter configuration

!!! tip ""

    First, configure recommended settings:

    1. Click `Menu` in the top right
    2. Enable settings shown below to ensure Voicemeeter:
        - Starts with Windows
        - Auto-recovers from audio issues

    <img src="/img/extras/audio/voicemeeter_menuopts.png">

    Next, set up ASIO output:

    1. Click the `A1` button in the top right
    2. Select the `ASIO (Steinberg)` tab 
    3. Choose your ASIO device

    Finally, configure audio routing:

    1. Locate the 4th column in the interface
    2. Enable only the `A1` and `B1` toggles as shown:

    <img src="/img/extras/audio/voicemeeter_outputs.png">

### OBS Studio Configuration

!!! tip ""

    1. Run OBS Studio's initial configuration wizard if you haven't already

    2. Set up audio capture:
        - In the Sources panel, click `+` and select `Audio Input Capture`
        <img src="/img/extras/audio/obs_inputcapture.png">
        - For the Device, select `VoiceMeeter Output (B1)`
        <img src="/img/extras/audio/obs_capturedevice.png">

    3. Enable audio monitoring:
        - Click the gear icon in the Audio Mixer panel
        - Find your Audio Input Capture source
        - Change `Audio Monitoring` to `Monitor and Output`
        <img src="/img/extras/audio/obs_monitorandoutput.png">

    4. Configure OBS audio settings:
        - Go to `File` > `Settings`
        <img src="/img/extras/audio/obs_settings.png">
        - In the `Audio` tab:
            - Set `Sample Rate` to match your ASIO/game settings
            - For `Monitoring Device`, select any unused input such as a `VoiceMeeter In`
        <img src="/img/extras/audio/obs_audiosettings.png">
        - Save changes with `Apply` and `OK`

    5. Add video capture:
        - In Sources, add either `Display Capture` or `Game Capture`
        - Adjust OBS video and output settings as needed

### Using this setup

!!! tip ""

    First, ensure Voicemeeter and OBS Studio are running.

    Next, configure your desired OBS output and video settings.

    - For streaming and recording, now use OBS as normal.

    - For Discord sharing:
        - Right-click the OBS preview window
        - Select `Fullscreen Projector (Preview)` 
        - Choose which monitor to show the projector on
        - Press Alt+Tab to switch away from the projector window
        - In Discord, share the projector window
