	- Chunithm expects the cabinets to be using specific IP addresses, 192.168.139.**11/12/13/14**
	- To achieve this over the internet, we can use SoftEther VPN. Refer to the [Setting Up SoftEther VPN Guide](/extras/softether.md) for more information.

### Configuring segatools.ini & Game Assignments

!!! tip "segatools.ini"

	```
	[netnev]
	enable=1
	addrSuffix= last 2 digits of your SoftEther IP

	[keychip]
	enable=1
	subnet=192.168.139.0
	id=(Everyone needs a seperate keychip. If you play on a remote network, chances are you already have your own keychip. If not, you can use the example keychips below.)
	;example keychips: A61E-01D02321145 ; A61E-01A30831145 ; A61E-01E38091145 ; A61E-01E46241145
	```

!!! tip "GAME ASSIGNMENTS"

	- After saving your segatools.ini, launch the game and go into the Service Menu > and go to ```GAME ASSIGNMENTS```.

	Exit the Service Menu and load into Attract Mode. If the game passes the Group Check then chances are you're good to go! You can now login to a credit and open a cab-to-cab link request to check if the connection is working properly!
