!!! tip ""

    segatools, by default, only accepts keyboard input and does not recognize any
    controllers. However, it can be configured with an IO DLL to add support for controllers.

    The controller you plan on using should also be provided with an IO DLL. If unsure,
    check the support section for your controller, or contact the vendor directly. Alternate
    options for the most common controllers are listed below.

    These IO DLLs should be copied to your game's `App\bin\` folder and referenced in
    `segatools.ini` under the `[chuniio]` section.
    
!!! tip ""

    To add your IO DLL, ncomment the `path=` line by removing the leading semicolon (`;`),
    then add your DLL's file name after the `=`:

    ```ini hl_lines="4"
    [chuniio]
    ; To use a custom Chunithm IO DLL enter its path here.
    ; Leave empty if you want to use Segatools built-in keyboard input.
    path=controller.dll
    ```

    1. Note that there is no leading semicolon.

### Keyboard

!!! tip ""

    Keyboard is the default input method, and while not recommended for playing the game,
    it is useful for testing purposes.
    
    The default layout uses `SDFGHJKL` for slider input, and `Space Bar` for the AIRs.

    If you wish to change the default keybinds, an explanation on how to set these is included
    above the `[io3]` section in your `segatools.ini`.
