### Clock error

!!! tip ""

	In the test menu, navigate to `CLOCK`, and set it to match your computer's time.

### The game is running slow/lagging

!!! tip ""

	Try to eliminate any unnecessary background processes during play.

### Unable to login / Eamuse error / Network error

!!! tip ""

	Get the proper Asphyxia plugin from our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cZRUmEPK78) in the #ddr channel > Resources post.
	Make sure you didn't enable `-smartea` in spicecfg's options.

### After choosing a song, the game freezes on the loading screen

!!! tip ""

	**This is likely a network issue.**
	
	If you're using a local network, make sure it's set up properly.
	
	If you're using a remote network, it's possible that the song or your game version isn't supported yet.

### Where are the option for Dancers/Shading/Measure lines/Fast-Slow/Layering?

!!! tip ""

	These options are locked behind network requirements and will not be displayed unless you are connected to a network that has written support for these options. Patches are available to mitigate this (see [Patches](setup.md#patches)).
