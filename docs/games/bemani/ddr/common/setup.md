!!! danger "Warning"

	Please make sure you downloaded your data from an appropriate source.
	This guide is unable to troubleshoot any problems related to bad or poorly managed data.

### About data

!!! info "The full game should be around 20-25gb in size."

!!! info ""

	Please keep the following in mind as you're going through this guide.  

	DDR's codename is `MDX`. Starting with `DDR A20` this would be either:

	- `MDX-001` *(Other cabs, 32 bits)*
	- `MDX-003` *(Gold cab, 64 bits)*

	The gold cab version contains more features, such as exclusive songs or the "GOLDEN LEAGUE" mode.

### Preparing data

!!! tip ""

	After downloading and extracting your data, we need to make sure your files aren't set to `Read-only`.

	- Right click the folder containing your data, then click on `Properties`.
	- In the `General` tab go down to `Attributes`, untick `Read-only` and click `Apply`.
	- A popup will appear, select `Apply changes to this folder, subfolder and files` and press `OK`.
	- Finally, click `OK` again to exit out of properties.

	You should end up with a file structure with a few folders only, as follows.

??? warning "If your data doesn't look like this"

	If you're missing the `modules` folder and instead have bunch of `.dll` files next to your folders:  

	- Create a `modules` folder.
	- Move all `.dll` files inside of it so you end up with a structure as shown above.

	If extra files are present next to your folders, such as executables, scripts, etc.. **remove them**.  
	**This also means your data was tampered with and we strongly recommend getting new data from somewhere else.**

---
### Updating data

??? danger "Please make sure you're using the right update for your current data."

	DDR Patches re-uploaded by the community tend to be appropriately named `MDX-DATECODE-to-DATECODE`.

	For example `MDX-2024091000-to-2024101500`.

	- `2024091000` being your current data's version.
	- `2024101500` being the one you would arrive at.

!!! tip ""

	- Extract your patch's files to your existing data in a way that matches its file structure. Agree to overwrite files if necessary.
	- Open `prop\ea3-config.xml` in a text editor and find the following lines near the top.

	```xml
		<soft>
			<model __type="str">MDX</model>
			<dest __type="str">J</dest>
			<spec __type="str">A</spec>
			<rev __type="str">A</rev>
			<ext __type="str">2024101500</ext>
		</soft>
	```

	On the line with `<ext __type="str">` the datecode needs to match your new version.

	- If that's already the case then great! Don't touch anything.
	- If it instead corresponds to your pre-patch datecode, replace it with the new one and save the file.

	Next you need a card number.  
	If you don't already have one, generate one in the `Cards` tab.  
	To keep your card number safe, create a new `.txt` file with ONLY it inside.

	Once that's done, head to the `Cards` tab, for `Player 1` click `Open...` and point to your text file.
