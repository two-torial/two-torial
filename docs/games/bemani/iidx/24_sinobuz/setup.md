### Preparing data

!!! tip ""

	After downloading and extracting your data, we need to make sure your files aren't set to `Read-only`.

	- Right click the folder containing your data, then click on `Properties`.
	- In the `General` tab go down to `Attributes`, untick `Read-only` and click `Apply`.
	- A popup will appear, select `Apply changes to this folder, subfolder and files` and press `OK`.
	- Finally, click `OK` again to exit out of properties.

	You should end up with a file structure with a few folders only, as follows.

??? warning "If your data doesn't look like this"

	If extra files are present next to your folders, such as executables, scripts, etc.. **remove them**.  
	**This also means your data was tampered with and we strongly recommend getting new data from somewhere else.**

### Configuring spice2x

!!! info "Open `spicecfg.exe`, each following sub-section corresponds to a tab at the top."

#### Buttons

!!! tip ""

	Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

	With your controller and/or keyboard plugged in, configure your keys for:  

	- **Maintenance**: `Service, Test`
	- **P1 Game buttons**: `1 to 7, Start, EFFECT, VEFX` 
	- **P1 Keypad**: `1 to 9, Keypad Insert Card` 

	**Only if** you're playing using a keyboard:

	- **Turntable**: `TT+, TT-` **and optionally** `TT+/-` which alternates between `TT+` and `TT-` on each press.
  
#### Analogs (controller/cab only)

!!! tip ""

	With a controller rather than binding buttons to `TT+` and `TT-`, you need to:

	- For Turntable P1, click `Bind`.
	- In `Device`, pick your controller.
	- In `Control`, pick whichever one corresponds to the turntable.
	- Turn your turntable ensuring that the Preview turns along with it.
	- Click `Close`, leaving the rest of the settings alone.

#### Overlay

!!! tip ""

	Modifying buttons in this section is not required but you are free to change what you want.

	Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

#### Lights (controller/cab only)

!!! tip ""

	Your controller might support having its lights controlled by the game through spice2x.

	If it does, here's how you may link different actions to your lights:

	- Click `Bind`.
	- In `Device`, pick your controller.
	- In `Light Control`, select the corresponding light.
	- Click `Close`.
	- Repeat for your other lights.

### Connecting to a network

!!! danger "Please choose one of the two solutions, not both!"

??? tip "Remote (Online Network)"

	Open `spicecfg.exe` and head to the `Options` tab.
  
	In the `Network` category, set the following settings: 
	
	- `EA Service URL` to the URL provided by your network.
	- `PCBID` to the PCBID provided by your network.
	
	<img src="/img/common/spice2x_network.png">

	Next you need a card number.  
	If you don't already have one, generate one in the `Cards` tab.  
	To keep your card number safe, create a new `.txt` file with ONLY it inside.

	Once that's done, head to the `Cards` tab, for `Player 1` click `Open...` and point to your text file.
