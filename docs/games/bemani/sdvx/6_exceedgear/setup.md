### Preparing data

!!! tip ""

	After downloading and extracting your data, we need to make sure your files aren't set to `Read-only`.

	- Right click the folder containing your data, then click on `Properties`.
	- In the `General` tab go down to `Attributes`, untick `Read-only` and click `Apply`.
	- A popup will appear, select `Apply changes to this folder, subfolder and files` and press `OK`.
	- Finally, click `OK` again to exit out of properties.

	You should end up with a file structure with a few folders only, as follows.

<img src="/img/bemani/sdvx/6_exceedgear/setup/data.png">

??? warning "If your data doesn't look like this"

	If you're missing the `modules` folder and instead have bunch of `.dll` files next to your folders:  

	- Create a `modules` folder.
	- Move all `.dll` files inside of it so you end up with a structure as shown above.

	If extra files are present next to your folders, such as executables, scripts, etc.. **remove them**.  
	**This also means your data was tampered with and we strongly recommend getting new data from somewhere else.**

!!! info "If you don't need to update your data, you can skip over to the [Installing spice2x](#installing-spice2x) section."

---
### Updating data

??? danger "Please make sure you're using the right update for your current data."

	SDVX Patches re-uploaded by the community tend to be appropriately named `KFC-DATECODE-to-DATECODE`.

	For example `KFC-2024043000-to-2024052100`.

	- `2024043000` being your current data's version.
	- `2024052100` being the one you would arrive at.

!!! tip ""

	- Extract your patch's files to your existing data in a way that matches its file structure. Agree to overwrite files if necessary.
	- Open `prop\ea3-config.xml` in a text editor and find the following lines near the top.

	```xml
		<soft>
			<model __type="str">KFC</model>
			<dest __type="str">J</dest>
			<spec __type="str">G</spec>
			<rev __type="str">A</rev>
			<ext __type="str">2024052100</ext>
		</soft>
	```

	On the line with `<ext __type="str">` the datecode needs to match your new version.

	- If that's already the case then great! Don't touch anything.
	- If it instead corresponds to our pre-patch datecode, replace it with the new one and save the file.

### Installing spice2x

!!! info ""

	If you already have spice2x installed, make sure it is up to date!

!!! tip ""

	- Head over to [spice2x.github.io](https://spice2x.github.io) and download the latest release.
	- Extract the `spice64.exe` and `spicecfg.exe` files from the archive to your game's directory.
  
	<img src="/img/bemani/sdvx/6_exceedgear/setup/spice2x64data.png">

??? warning "If you're using an AMD graphics card"

	A few more files are required to make your game work with AMD as the game was built for NVIDIA.

	- From the spice2x archive, extract the `.dll` files found in `spice2x\stubs\64\` to your data's `modules` folder.

	<img src="/img/bemani/sdvx/6_exceedgear/setup/dllamd.png">

### Configuring spice2x

!!! info "Open `spicecfg.exe`, each following sub-section corresponds to a tab at the top."

#### Buttons

!!! tip ""

	Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

	With your controller and/or keyboard plugged in, configure your keys for:  

	- **Maintenance:** `Service, Test`

	- **Knobs:** `VOL-L Left, VOL-L Right, VOL-R Left, Vol-R Right`
  
#### Analogs (controller/cab only)

!!! tip ""

	With a controller rather than binding buttons to VOL-L and VOL-R, you need to:

	- Click `Bind`.
	- In `Device`, pick your controller.
	- In `Control`, pick `X` for `VOL-L` or `Y` for `VOL-R`.
	- Turn your knob ensuring that the Preview knob turns along with it.
	- Click `Close`, leaving the rest of the settings alone.
	- Repeat for your other knob.

#### Overlay

!!! tip ""

	Modifying buttons in this section is not required but you are free to change what you want.

	Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

#### Lights (controller/cab only)

!!! tip ""

	Your controller might support having its lights controlled by the game through spice2x.

	If it does, here's how you may link different actions to your lights:

	- Click `Bind`.
	- In `Device`, pick your controller.
	- In `Light Control`, select the corresponding light.
	- Click `Close`.
	- Repeat for your other lights.

### Connecting to a network

!!! danger "Please choose one of the two solutions, not both!"

??? tip "Remote (Online Network)"

	Open `spicecfg.exe` and head to the `Options` tab.

	- `EA Service URL` to the URL provided by your network.
	- `PCBID` to the PCBID provided by your network.
	
	<img src="/img/common/spice2x_network.png">

	Next you need a card number.  
	If you don't already have one, generate one in the `Cards` tab.  
	To keep your card number safe, create a new `.txt` file with ONLY it inside.

	Once that's done, head to the `Cards` tab, for `Player 1` click `Open...` and point to your text file.
